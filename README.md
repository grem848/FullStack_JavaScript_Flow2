# Assignment 2 FullStack JavaScript
## Period-2 Node.js, Express + JavaScript Backend Testing, NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

# Explain and Reflect

>## Why would you consider a Scripting Language as JavaScript as your Backend Platform?

>## Explain Pros & Cons in using Node.js + Express to implement your Backend compared to a strategy using, for example, Java/JAX-RS/Tomcat

>## Node.js uses a Single Threaded Non-blocking strategy to handle asynchronous task. Explain strategies to implement a Node.js based server architecture that still could take advantage of a multi-core Server.

>## Explain briefly how to deploy a Node/Express application including how to solve the following deployment problems:

* ### Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a (potential) exception that closed the application
* ### Ensure that you Node-process restarts after a server (Ubuntu) restart
* ### Ensure that you can take advantage of a multi-core system
* ### Ensure that you can run “many” node-applications on a single droplet on the same port (80)

>## Explain the difference between “Debug outputs” and application logging. What’s wrong with console.log(..) statements in our backend-code.

>## Demonstrate a system using application logging and “coloured” debug statements.

>## Explain, using relevant examples, concepts related to testing a REST-API using Node/JavaScript + relevant packages 

>## Explain, using relevant examples, the Express concept; `middleware`
>## Explain, using relevant examples, how to implement sessions and the legal implications of doing this.

>## Compare the express strategy toward (server side) templating with the one you used with Java on second semester.

>## Demonstrate a simple Server Side Rendering example using a technology of your own choice (pug, EJS, ..).

>## Explain, using relevant examples, your strategy for implementing a REST-API with Node/Express and show how you can "test" all the four CRUD operations programmatically using, for example, the Request package.

>## Explain, using relevant examples, about testing JavaScript code, relevant packages (Mocha etc.) and how to test asynchronous code.
>## Explain, using relevant examples, different ways to mock out databases, HTTP-request etc.

>## Explain, preferably using an example, how you have deployed your node/Express applications, and which of the Express Production best practices you have followed.


# NoSQL, MongoDB and Mongoose

>## Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.

>## Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional Relational SQL Database like MySQL.

>## Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB


>## Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.

This topic will be introduced in period-3

>## Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere

These two topics will be introduced in period-3

>## Demonstrate, using a REST-API you have designed, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB

>## Explain the benefits of using Mongoose, and demonstrate, using your own code, an example involving all CRUD operations

>## Explain the “6 Rules of Thumb: Your Guide Through the Rainbow” as to how and when you would use normalization vs. denormalization.

>## Demonstrate, using your own code-samples, decisions you have made regarding → normalization vs denormalization 

>## Explain, using a relevant example, a full JavaScript backend including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the production database)
